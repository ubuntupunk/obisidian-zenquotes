# Obsidian XenQuotes Plugin

## Project Overview
This project is based on the Obsidian sample plugin for Obsidian. It has evolved into a simple plugin that provides users with a random quote of the day, inspirational images, and an "On This Day" feature to pull historical quotes based on the current date.

## Features
- Fetch random quotes
- Fetch quotes of the day
- Fetch and save random images alongside quotes
- **On This Day**: Fetch historical quotes based on the current date.

## On This Day Feature
The On This Day feature allows users to retrieve notable events, births, and deaths that occurred on the current date. The data is fetched from the ZenQuotes API and displayed in a structured format.

### Usage
To use the On This Day feature, simply enable it in the plugin settings and trigger the fetch action. The historical data will be inserted into your current note.
